h1. How we make decisions

How do we make decisions in a decentralized organized with no managers? 
By decentralizing the decision-making itself. The guiding principle is that decisions should be made by the person who feel most engaged in the decision, but with respect for the points of view of people affected by the decision.

We call this the _Consultation Process_ ("Rådføringsprocessen" in Danish).

Note – for allocation of consultants to client engagements we have a specific protocol for that – the "bun protocol":bun-protocol.html. Similar for recruitment decisions.

h2. How does the Consultation Process work?

The proces is quite simple:

* Any one can make any decision
* When making decisions one must seek the counsel of people affected by the decision

The counsel can be sought bilaterally or in groups, and usually the decision proposal is adjusted based on the counsel of the peers. Sometimes the counsel sessions are repeated multiple times before a decision is made. But the decision is always in the hands of the person driving the decision-making. 

This also means that the counsel of the peers does not have to be heeded if the person driving the decision-making is not convinced and believe strongly in his or her own proposal.

h2. Why don’t we have a centalized decision-making process?

It is important for us that people are free to use their autonomy and not feel hindered by a cumbersome decision-making structure. But it is also important that people do not feel that decisions affecting them are made without asking them.

We believe in building an organisation where the autonomy of the individual is balanced by the needs of the community, and we believe that such an organisation is stronger and a better place to work than one where this balance is upset. 

h2. Which decisions are made with the Consultation Process?

Basically all of them!

Sometimes the decision is so small and reversible that the decision driver does not feel the need for peer counsel. Or perhaps the decision is quite personal and the counsel to sought form outsiders, eg. family and friends.

Other times the decision affects each and every individual in {{ site.company_name }} and the counsel will be very close to consensus seeking. In such a situation the driver of the decision will normally facilitate the counsel of all and ensure that a sufficient amount are active backing the decision and no-one is opposed to the decision. This would look and feel very much like a consensus seeking decision process, but is basically just the _Consultation Process_ where many are affected.


bq. *Meta:* How does Crisp do this?
This is not one of the areas where we are inspired by Crisp. Crisp does not have *one* well defined decision-making process but has many loosely defined processes
You can read about Crisp's decision processes at http://dna.crisp.se/docs/decisions.html

The inspiration for our decision-making process comes from [Reinventing Organisations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com) by Frederic Laloux. If you are interested in alternative ways to run organisations you should really read this extraordinary book.

h2. What if somebody disagrees strongly with a decision?

Sometimes our autonomy focused decision-making process results in people feeling strongly about a decision made by somebody else - and sometimes negatively so (it really happens more seldom than one would think). When this happens our "conflict process":conflict-handling.html come into play.

h2. How do I pick a decision process?

Here are some examples of different decisions processes on a scale from “fast” to “well-anchored”.

* *Own decision*. Decide yourself without talking to anyone.
* *Own decision with team input*. Ask for input from the team, but then make the decision yourself.
* *Own decision with team-anchoring*. Ask for input from the team, suggest a decision, check if the team is OK with it before closing the decision.
* *Team decision*. Facilitate a decision from the whole team (using consensus, with majority vote as fallback if we can’t reach consensus).

The term “team” in this case really means “those who are affected by the decision”. Sometimes the whole team, sometimes just a few individuals.

These decisions processes can be combined. For example, start by getting input from the whole team, then suggest a decision and anchor with those people who are most directly affected.

For simple decisions, this communication can happen via email or an online poll. For more complex or sensitive decisions, face-to-face conversation is better. We usually do those at our "unconference":unconference.html, using "hand signals":hand-signals.html to support the conversation and decision process.

Some things to consider when choosing a decisions process:

* *Who is affected?* Only you? You and a few others? The whole team?
* *How important is this question to you?* How important is it to those who are affected? Is it a critical decision or trivial one?
* *Is the decision reversible?* Most decisions are. What is the consequence of making the “wrong” decision, and who is affected by that?
* *How easy or hard is the decision?* How easy is it to reach consensus with all people affected?
* *How urgent is the decision?* What is the consequence of delaying the decision, or not making a decision at all?
* *Who are you?* The decision process may vary depending on your perspective – consultant, board member, office admin, etc. May also depend on how long you’ve been at Crisp (if you are new and unsure you might need to seek more anchoring from people).
* *Is the outcome affected by laws?* The board of directors in a Danish company is bound by Danish laws, so some decisions must be aligned with the board of directors.

Sample decisions:

* “Should I arrange a free seminar with Lyssa Adkins” => *Own decision*. Just do it.
* “Which color should we have on the Crisp cup?” => *Own decision with team input*.
* “How often should we do Crisp unconferences?” => *Own decision with team anchoring*.
* “Should we divided the company into two business units?” => *Team decision*.

At the end of the day it’s about balancing risk. If you make the decision yourself it will be fast, but you risk a backlash if others don’t support it. If you seek 100% consensus you may get a better decision with better support, but it could take time – especially for questions where people have opposing opinions.

There is no perfect process, so seek a balance between these extremes! We most often end up in the middle of the scale – “own decision with team input” or “own decision with team anchoring” (where “team” isn’t necessarily the whole team)

h2. What if I still feel unsure of which decision process to use?

Here are some options:

* *Take a chance!* “Better to ask for forgiveness than permission”. Most decisions are reversible, so you don’t really need to be afraid of making the “wrong” decision or using the “wrong” decision process. Just accept feedback and learn.
* *Talk to a Crisp colleague*, for example someone who has been around longer and can give examples of what has worked in the past.
* *Check if someone else can drive* the question for you (or with you). Preferably someone who is strongly engaged in the question. For example if I want next Crisp unconference to be in the Maldives I’d involve the "office team":office-team.html, since they usually arrange our unconferences. It’s nice to pair-drive a decision, so you can always ask on the team mailing list to find a co-driver.
* *Escalate the decision* to the "board of directors":board.html. For example “hey board, I want to change our recruiting process, how would we make a decision like that?”. We try to minimize the number of decisions that have to be made by the board, but they can give useful input about who needs to be involved.

Our "unconferences":unconference.html and similar gatherings are a great place to discuss a decision process – and in many cases make the actual decision as well, since everyone is there :)

h2. How decision-making looks like

So, decision making can look like this:

… or like this, for slightly bigger issues:

… or like this, for big issues that affect everyone:

bq. This was the meeting where we decided to remove the CEO role. For a few years we’d had a rotating CEO role, time-boxed to 30% of full-time. A small group (including the current CEO) discussed the issue during our "unconference":unconference.html, and brought up the concrete proposal to the whole team at the end of the day. A quick consensus check (via "hand signals":hand-signals.html) and the decision was done! We agreed that the CEO role had fulfilled a purpose, but now the "office team":office-team.html was capable of dealing with stuff without having a CEO.
(and what happened to the current CEO? Well, he was happy to be able to drop the role and go back to client-facing work!)

The "open format":unconference.html of our conference is quite essential to our decision making process, plus the "hand signals":hand-signals.html.
